_**Video Transcript**_

[00:00:00] Hello everybody. is Roger Brogan. And today we're going to do a video on upgrading pocket core. We're going to upgrade specifically the binaries here. The version that I'm on right now is RC 0.5.0, we can verify that by just doing a quick pocket version, which I am on released candidate  0.5.0. The, the new release candidate is RC 0.5.1 and if you follow this guide , they're telling you to go ahead and delete the old tag and get the most up-to-date tag.  so if we go ahead and remove this tag and then we take a look at our tags. We can see that it is in fact gone,  but, how do we get it back? Good question. Okay. We need to get the correct one back by doing a, get fetch the dash T option to pull down the tags and we'll see that we have the new tag now. [00:01:00] And if we take a look at the hash, it starts with the D six C zero six eight.

[00:01:09] And if we take a look on their get hub and look at their tags for their releases for the release candidate. Oh five one, and we look at the hash . That is in fact the correct hash  zero six, eight two. So this is the one that we want. So now we can go ahead and proceed with the rest of the directions .

[00:01:31] Make sure that, you know, we have everything pulled. We just did a good fetch  the date. And then we're going to go ahead and be able to check out that tag. So. Let's do our get check out tags.

[00:01:48] all right. So we're in detached head state. We've checked out the correct tag, and then we're going to issue this command right here to go ahead and build. So let's go ahead and [00:02:00] just copy that one out of the docs and that seems happy. Let's check our version and voila. We're up to release candidate. Oh five one. Now we've done a successful update of our binary to the latest version. Thank you very much.
